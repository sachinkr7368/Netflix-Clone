## For Bonus Points
  - I used React instead of Vue solely because I'm more familiar with React.
  - Used a fast library. Used styled-Components for best performance and used best practices for writing Javascript code. 
  - The website is fully mobile responsive, I've made sure that every little detail looks good on mobile! I focused on making an easy-to-use User Interface (UI) for great constrast and visual appeal.Experience (UX). Moreover, I've written all styling code by myself;
  
  
## Thought Process
  - Idea was to use the little dark color scheme  for dashboard and as grey for page.
  - I searched through all the given datasets to look for attributes that would intrigue a person who knows cricket but has never watched IPL. 
  - I wanted the Navigation bar to initially be in 'full' state while browsing on desktop and in 'minimal' state while on mobile to give mobile users more space yet       have menu items easily accessible in one click.
  -I went with Chart.js as it provided many predefined graphs.
  - When looking for a CSV file parsing solution i just thought of converting it to json and we can do the same with papaparse too.
  - Making a mobile responsive website is a must in 2022. With mobile in-mind, I carefully planned my layout design. I used grid layout and flex box for most of my         layout design process.
  - The top bar seemed empty, so I added a login and Signup so it looks better and later i can implement its functionality also.
  - Added Icon according to the category and subnavs to for better experience in phone and pc if we later want to go with category.
  
  ## For backend
  - Used node and mongo connect to server and can add fav movies in the list and remove
  
  ### Running process
   - Download the zip file in ur PC
   - unzip and run with vs code
   - install all libraries using  npm i
   - then run it on local server using npm start
   - now run the backend server in api folder using node.  it will connect to the server
   
   Thanks.
